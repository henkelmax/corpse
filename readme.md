This mod brings a corpse into the game.
It will spawn upon your death containing all items that you had in your inventory.


# Features

The corpse will appear at the players location upon death.
Your player skin will be applied to the corpse.
It contains all the items you had when you died.
It can hold an infinite amount of items.

When you take out all items, the corpse will disappear.
The corpse can't fall into the void or burn in lava.
It also floats in liquids like lava or water.

After 1 hour, the corpse will turn into a skeleton, indicating that it existed for a longer time.
This won't change the functionality of the corpse.
